Description: greylisting implementation for Postfix
 This package provides a policy server for Postfix to implement "greylisting".
 .
 Greylisting is a spam filtering method that rejects email from external
 servers on the first try. Spammers don't usually retry sending their
 messages, whereas legitimate mail servers do.
 .
 While Postgrey is designed for use with Postfix, it can also be used
 with Exim.
 .
 This version has been modified by Mail-in-a-Box to whitelist senders
 in the DNSWL.org list. See https://mailinabox.email.
