This is a source package with a quilt patch series.

I use the (yet to be released) hgdebuild to keep the patches in a (yet to be
published) hg repository, but you can just as well use quilt to manage the
patch series.

Please add modifications in new patches.  The first patch
(imported-upstrea-diff) is merely the lump of changes I haven't reworked in the
svn -> hg conversion.
