postgrey (1.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Postgrey is now listening to port 10023 and not 60000.  The latter was an
  unnecessary Debian specific modification.  You will need to adjust your
  configuration (usually /etc/postfix/main.cf) accordingly.

postgrey (1.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of postgrey introduces the --auto-whitelist-clients option
  (enabled by default, use --auto-whitelist-clients=0 to disable):  after
  several (5 by default) emails from a client have passed through regular
  greylisting, it is assumed that this client is a legitimate source of
  email and is added to the whitelist:  further emails from the same client
  are not subject to greylisting.

postgrey (1.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With 1.14, the default is now --lookup-by-subnet, so you have to specify
  --lookup-by-host to get the old behaviour.  Because of this, some entries
  were deleted from /etc/postgrey/whitelist_clients.

  Also, the --max-age default was changed from 14 to 30 days.
